A DayZ Battleye Filter Repository for DayZ


How to install
-------------
Just copy the Files of a map into your Battleye Folder and then reload scripts or restart the server


Purpose of this Repository
-------------
The key difference between this Repository and others is that I want the focus on Filters which minimize log output.
This is done by adding exceptions to the filters.
Other Repositorys like the Community Filters only have Exceptions for the most necessary to get the game to run.
This is okay of course - but like the most of you I hate it to add exceptions every time I add a little feature and then a new version of DayZ requires a new set of Filters.
